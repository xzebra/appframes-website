## Troubleshooting Upload Issues

### Connection Problems

### Upload Failures

- **Verify file format** is PNG (not JPEG)
- **Ensure content compliance** with App Store guidelines
- **Try smaller batches** if uploading many screenshots

### Missing Screenshots
- **Check language settings** in both AppFrames and App Store Connect

- **Look for validation errors** in upload results
- **Re-export and try again** if issues persist

## Best Practices

- [ ] **All screenshots reviewed** and approved
- [ ] **Text is readable** and properly localized
