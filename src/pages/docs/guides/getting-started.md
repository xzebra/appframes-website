# Getting Started with AppFrames

Welcome to AppFrames! In just a few minutes, you'll have professional App Store screenshots ready for submission. Here's how to get started.

## Your First Screenshot

### 1. Create a New Project

1. Launch AppFrames from your Applications folder
2. Click **"New Project"** 
3. Your project starts with iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices ready to use

### 2. Drag and Drop Your Screenshots

1. **Select a device** from the sidebar (start with iPhone)
2. **Drag your app screenshot** from Finder directly onto the canvas
3. AppFrames automatically positions your screenshot in the device frame

The screenshot will appear with automatic positioning - your app's interface shows clearly within the device frame.

### 3. Add Your Marketing Text

1. **Click the text area** below your screenshot
2. **Type your headline** - something like "Advanced Photo Editing Made Simple"
3. **Add body text** (optional) for more details about your app's benefits

Your text automatically positions opposite to your screenshot for perfect composition.

### 4. Style Your Screenshot

Use the **Inspector panel** (right sidebar) to customize:

- **Text styling**: Change font, size, weight, and color
- **Background**: Adjust background colors or gradients  
- **Image position**: Choose from 8 alignment options
- **Device frame**: Customize bezels and shadows

### 5. Export or Upload

When you're happy with your screenshot:

- **Export**: Click **"Export All"** to save PNG files to your Mac
- **Upload**: Click **"Upload to App Store"** to send directly to App Store Connect

## Adding More Screenshots

### Multiple Screenshots Per Device
1. **Click the "+" button** next to your device in the sidebar
2. **Add more screenshots** to show different app features
3. **Duplicate existing screenshots** to maintain consistent styling

### Multiple Devices
Your project includes iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default:
- **iPhone screenshots**: For mobile App Store listings
- **iPad screenshots**: For tablet-optimized layouts  
- **Mac screenshots**: For desktop app listings

Each device maintains its own set of screenshots with proper App Store dimensions.

## Going Global with Languages

### Add Languages
1. **Click "Translations"** in the toolbar
2. **Click the "+" button** in the languages panel
3. **Select your target languages** (Spanish, French, German, etc.)
4. **Click "Add Selected"**

### Translate Your Text
1. **Select a language** from the sidebar (not English)
2. **Find your text** in the translation table
3. **Click and type your translation**
4. **Preview** by switching languages in the main window

Your screenshots automatically update with translated text while keeping the same visual design.

## A/B Testing Different Approaches

### Create Variants
1. **Find the Variant Picker** in the canvas controls
2. **Click the "+" button** to create a new variant
3. **Name it descriptively** like "Benefit Focus" or "Feature Highlight"

### Test Different Messages
Switch between variants to test:
- **Different headlines**: "Fast Photo Editing" vs "Professional Results"
- **Different layouts**: Image at top vs bottom
- **Different styles**: Dark vs light backgrounds

Each variant inherits your base design but lets you override specific elements.

## Ready to Submit

### Export for App Store
1. **Click "Export All"** in the toolbar
2. **Choose your export location**
3. AppFrames generates properly sized PNG files organized by device type

Your files are named correctly for App Store Connect (like `iPhone6.9_en_01.png`) and ready for direct upload.

### Direct Upload
1. **Click "Upload to App Store"** in the toolbar
2. **Sign in with your Apple ID**
3. **Select your app** and version
4. AppFrames uploads everything automatically with proper organization

## Tips for Great Screenshots

- **Keep headlines short** - 5-8 words work best for mobile viewing
- **Show your app in action** - actual interface screenshots convert better than graphics
- **Use consistent styling** across all screenshots in your set
- **Test different approaches** with variants to see what works best
- **Preview on actual devices** when possible to check readability
