# Getting Started with AppFrames

Welcome to AppFrames! In just a few minutes, you'll have professional App Store screenshots ready for submission. Here's how to get started.

## Your First Screenshot

### 1. Create a New Project

1. Launch AppFrames from your Applications folder
2. Create a new file. It's recommended to save it in iCloud so you can sync it between devices.
3. Your project starts with iPhone, iPad, and Mac devices ready to use. Feel free to delete those you don't need.

### 2. Drag and Drop Your Screenshots

1. **Select a device** from the sidebar (start with iPhone)
2. **Drag your app screenshot** from Finder/Simulator directly onto the canvas. If you drop them within a screenshot frame, it will add/replace the frame image. If you drop them on the canvas (grid background) it'll create new screenshot frames for you.
3. AppFrames automatically positions your screenshot in the device frame

The screenshot will appear with automatic positioning - your app's interface shows clearly within the device frame.

### 3. Add Your Marketing Text

1. Select a screenshot
2. Open the right **Inspector panel**, you'll see a section called "Text content"
2. **Type your headline** - something like "Advanced Photo Editing Made Simple"
3. **Add body text** (optional) for more details about your app's benefits. Most screenshots don't usually need this.

Your text automatically positions opposite to your screenshot for perfect composition.

### 4. Style Your Screenshot

Without any screenshot selected (tap outside to deselect), use the **Inspector panel** (right sidebar) to customize:

- **Text styling**: Change font, size, weight, and color
- **Background**: Adjust background colors or gradients  
- **Image position**: Choose from 8 alignment options
- **Device frame**: Customize bezels and shadows

This properties will apply to all screenshots and devices for consistency. Some can be overriden in the screenshot specific panel.

### 5. Export or Upload

When you're happy with your screenshot:

- **Export**: Click **"Export All"** (file with a down arrow icon) to save PNG files to your Mac
- **Upload**: Click **"Upload to App Store"** to send directly to App Store Connect

## Adding More Screenshots

### Multiple Screenshots Per Device

Simply drag and drop more images to the background. They will keep the same styling as the rest.
**Add more screenshots** to show different app features.

### Multiple Devices
Your project includes iPhone, iPad, and Mac by default:
- **iPhone screenshots**: For mobile App Store listings
- **iPad screenshots**: For tablet-optimized layouts  
- **Mac screenshots**: For desktop app listings

Each device maintains its own set of screenshot images with proper App Store dimensions.

## Going Global with Languages

### Add Languages
1. **Click "Translations"** in the toolbar
2. **Click the "+" button** in the languages panel
3. **Select your target languages** (Spanish, French, German, etc.)
4. **Click "Add Selected"**

### Translate Your Text
1. **Select a language** from the sidebar (not English)
2. **Find your text** in the translation table
3. **Click and type your translation**
4. **Preview** by switching languages in the main window

Your screenshots automatically update with translated text while keeping the same visual design.

## A/B Testing Different Approaches

### Create Variants
1. **Find the Variant Picker** in the bottom right canvas controls
2. Click it and **click the "+" button** to create a new variant
3. **Name it descriptively** like "Benefit Focus" or "Feature Highlight"

### A/B Test different changes
Switch between variants to test:
- **Different headlines**: "Fast Photo Editing" vs "Professional Results"
- **Different layouts**: Image at top vs bottom
- **Different styles**: Dark vs light backgrounds

Each variant inherits your base design but lets you override specific elements.

### Upload to the App Store

When uploading to the App Store, you can select *Experiment* instead of *Product Page*. It'll prompt you to create a new experiment if you don't have any ready to receive screenshots.

You can match variants to each treatment of the experiment. The control group will always be the current set of released screenshots (may not be your Main variant).

## Tips for Great Screenshots

- **Keep headlines short** - 5-8 words work best for mobile viewing
- **Show your app in action** - actual interface screenshots convert better than graphics
- **Use consistent styling** across all screenshots in your set
- **Test different approaches** with variants to see what works best
- **Preview on actual devices** when possible to check readability
