## Design Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Branding
- Use your app's brand colors throughout the mockup
- Maintain consistent typography across all elements

## Working with Layers

- Organize layers by functionality

### Blending and Effects
- Apply subtle shadows and highlights

- Add color overlays for mood
- Keep effects tasteful and professional

## Export Optimization

### For Mac App Store
- Follow Apple's screenshot guidelines
- Use recommended dimensions (1280Ã—800, 1440Ã—900, 2880Ã—1800)
- Test on different display sizes
- Ensure text remains readable

### For Marketing
- Consider where the image will be used
- Optimize file sizes for web usage

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Overcrowding**: Leave white space for breathing room
2. **Inconsistent scaling**: Maintain proportional relationships between elements
3. **Poor contrast**: Ensure text is always readable against backgrounds

5. **Ignoring guidelines**: Follow platform-specific requirements and best practices
